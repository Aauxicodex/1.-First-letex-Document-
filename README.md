# using-basic-letex-document-property-
This LaTeX code sets up a document with the `article` class, specifying parameters like font size (12pt), layout (twoside), and paper size (A4). Within the document environment, it contains the text "a small \LaTeX document", which will be typeset with LaTeX's default formatting. The document can be expanded with additional content and formatting commands to create more complex documents.

```
\documentclass[12pt,twoside,a4paper]{article} 
\begin{document} 
a small \LaTeX document 
\end{document}
